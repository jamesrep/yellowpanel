# yellowpanel
Kibana plugin to list Elasticsearch tasks and cancel specific or all tasks at once. Basically used as a template for new kibana plugins. 

Why the name yellowpanel? 
- It is sort of blue.
- Also, it is 2019 so we need to think green!

# Install

In kibana.yml set:

* yellowpanel.esHost: theipofelasticsearch
* yellowpanel.esPort: theportofelasticsearch
